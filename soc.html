          <h1>Use of Statistics in Soccer</h1>
        </div>
        <p>Soccer/world football is a sport involving two teams of players kicking and heading a
            medium-sized ball about on a large rectangular field. Each team has a goal that is quite
            wide and high and seeks to shoot the ball into the other team's goal. The basic objective is
            to see which team of the two can score the most goals and thereby win the game. The
            sport is subject to Laws set down by the Federation Internationale de Football (FIFA).
            Typically there is a group of teams playing against each other in a league or tournament
            with a formal schedule of games. A team's intention then is to win a tournament or
            championship by obtaining the most points, where 3 are awarded for a win, 1 for a tie and
            0 for a loss.</p>
        <p>The sport of soccer has a long and full history possibly going back to 2500 BC,
            Henshaw (1979). In the present time the teams each have eleven players. One, the goalie,
            may handle the ball but only within a restricted area in front of his goal. There is a neutral
            referee whose decisions are final. The grandest tournament, the World Cup, moves
            amongst different countries and occurs nominally every four years .The past world
            champions are Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil, England, France, Germany and Italy. The
            sport has become a multi-billion dollar business.
            </p>

        <p>Tactics are basic to the games with many styles and plating formations available. A
            team's choice has been based, in part, on studies of match statistics. The pioneer in the
            field of match performance analysis is Charles Reep, see Larsen (2001) and Pollard
            (2002).</p>

        <h2>1. DATA COLLECTION AND DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSES</h2>

        <p>Data collection and analysis have been basic to soccer for many years. The most
            common statistics are a game's result and the number of goals scored by each team.
            Outputs of data analyses include: reports, tables, graphs, talks, images, and videos.
            </p>

        <p>Many things go on during a game. A basic question is what is to be recorded for
            analysis and how to do so. Charles Reep, see Larsen (2001) and Pollard (2002),
            developed solutions starting in the early 1950s. The study of basic events in a game has
            been called both match performance analysis and match analysis, see Reilly and Thomas
            (1976), Larsen (2001), McGarry and Franks (2003), and Hughes (2003).
            </p>

        <p>A recent addition to the type of information available is near continuous highfrequency digital spatial-temporal data for individual games. Companies come to a
            stadium and set up an array of video cameras. By signal processing they then develop the
            spatial-temporal coordinates of the changing locations of the players on the field, the ball
            and the referee. Companies doing this include: Match Analysis, Prozone Holdings, and
            Sport-Universal SA. Di Salvo et al. (2006) have validated one such system. Basic
            quantities that may now be tabled directly include counts of: tackles, crosses, distances
            covered, key moments and actions, possessions, passes, interceptions, runs with the ball,
            incorrect referee decisions, fouls, penalty kicks, challenges, entries into the opponent's area, ball touches, blocks, forward passes, long balls, high intensity running, ball velocity
            and accuracy, balls received. Individual player's performances may be evaluated directly.
            The data can lead to changes in tactics during a game, see Carling, Williams and Reilly
            (2009). Substantial soccer databases have been available for many years. Websites
            include: www.eufa.com, www.fifa.com, www.soccerbase.com, www.soccerway.com,
            and www.soccerpunter.com .</p>
        <p>One early investigation of basic data is that of Moroney (1951), pp. 101-103. He
            studied the numbers of goals scored in 480 games and prepared a histogram of the counts.
            In another early study the numbers of successful passes in passing movements were
            studied for the English First Division during the years 1957-58 and 1961-62 in Reep and
            Benjamin (1968). The results were presented in tabular form. Reep and Benjamin found a
            stable correspondence between shots on goal and goals scored of about 10 to 1. Distances
            traveled by individual players during a game are graphed by player position in Reilly and
            Thomas (1976). Hughes and Franks (2008) present scatter and time series plots. One
            early discovery was the existence of a home advantage. Schedules are often set up so that
            two teams meet both at home and away to deal with this. Jochems (1958, 1962), while
            addressing the question of whether the Dutch football pools were breaking the gambling
            laws, found the percentages to be 46.6 for a home win, 31.0 for a visitor win and 22.4 for
            a draw/tie. Managers make use such data in their decision-making, more so every year.
            Stochastic models are important in this connection.</p>

        <h2>2. STOCHASTIC MODELLING</h2>
        <p>Stochastic models are pertinent to soccer statistics because is there is much uncertainty in
            what happens and what may happen. During the preceding fifty years stochastic models
            have been constructed to address soccer questions. Some models may be distinguished as
            to concerning goals, win-tie-loss, or points. Specific distributions and models that have
            been employed include: bivariate Poisson, exponential, extreme value, GARCH,
            generalized linear, logistic, Markov, negative binomial, ordinal, regression, prior, point
            process, and state space. Many analyses are based on the Poisson distribution whose
            probability function is given by</p>

        <p>Prob{Y=y} = 
            y
            e
            -y
             /y! for y = 0,1,2,...</p>

        <p>Here Y might represent the number of goals a team scores in a future game. In early work
            Moroney (1951), using the data mentioned above, compared the number of goals scored
            by a team in a game to their estimated expected frequency assuming that a Poisson
            distribution held. On examining the result he was led to seek to improve it and fit a
            negative binomial distribution. This is a generalization of the Poisson. This fit was
            satisfactory. However Greanhough et al (2002) found that when data from 169 countries
            were pooled extreme value distributions were needed.</p>

        <p>Reep et al (1968, 1971) work with the numbers of passes in successful passing
            movements. They fit the negative binomial and found it was good when 0-length cases
            were excluded.</p>

        <p>Suppose next that team i at home is playing against team j visiting. Denote the final
            score by (Xij,Yij). Various authors have assumed that Xij and Yij are independent Poissons
            with respective means,</p>

        <p>ij , ij Maher (1982)</p>
        <p>exp{ +  + i + j}, exp{ + j + i} Kuonen (1996) and Lee (1997)
            ij , ji Dixon and Coles (1997)
            exp{ +  + i - j - (i - j)}, exp{ + j - i + (i - j)} Rue and Salvesen (2000)</p>

        <p>Here  is a home advantage,  is a psychological effect and i = i + i . In their fitting
            Dixon and Coles modify the low score model probabilities. The probability that team i
            wins the game may be estimated having estimated the model parameters.</p>

        <p>Maher (1982) estimates , , ,  by maximum likelihood and mentions fitting the
            bivariate Poisson. Karlis and Ntzoufras (2003) give details of fitting a bivariate Poisson
            studying the data for 24 leagues. They find that the assumption of independence is not
            rejected in 15 cases out of the 24. They also consider the negative binomial distribution
            and the inclusion of interaction terms.
            </p>

        <p>The goal difference Xij - Yij is also important. It determines whether a game result is
            win, tie or loss (W, T, or L) and is used to resolve conflicts when the points are equal.
            Stefani (1980) considers the model
            </p>

        <p>Xij - Yij =  + i - j + random error</p>
        <p>with  the home advantage and the i called rankings. Karlis and Ntzoufras (2009) fit the
            Poisson difference distribution to observed goal differences including a home effect,
            attacking, and defensive parameters. </p>

        <p>Fahrmeir and Tutz (1994) employ a logistic latent variable-cutpoint setup to model an
            ordinal-valued variable. Their model is</p>

        <p>Prob{Yij = r} = F(r+i -j) - F(r+i-j) for r = W, T, L</p>
        <p>with F the logistic and i the ability of team i. In contrast Brillinger (1996, 2007, 2008,
            2009) employs an extreme value variable-cutpoint approach. It leads to the model</p>
