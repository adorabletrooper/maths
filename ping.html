      <p>Maths is used for making this Ping Pong ball Game in various aspects. It is applied in the creation of the board, the ball, the animations, the effect of the ball striking the pad, reflection of the ball and many more. </p>
      <p>I have used certain mathematical variables to construct the dimensions of the game, which includes the dimensions of the window, the ball, the margins, etc. The velocity of the ball needed to be configured by me, such that whenever the ball touches the padding of the player, the ball gains velocity by 5fps. This increases the difficulty and amazement of the game.</p>
      <p>Games usually have their in-built clock mechanism in them, where the entire data about the game is stored, along with frames per second. This helps game developers to make sure the game continues into a loop and doesn't breaks in between.</p>
      <p>Game Developer Giants like Electronic Arts(EA) uses more advanced measures to make their game realistic and adventurous. More complexity is introduced to their game developers, which mean more complex algorithms to written. The algorithms mainly consists of mathematical reasoning and equations problems. Maths help them to produce long codes for efficient, fast performance of their games.</p>
      <p>For my part, I just simply used basic algorithms to create this game, although it took mearound a week to develop. Maths helped me alot in this case.</p>
